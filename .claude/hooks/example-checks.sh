# The example app's tests exercise library code paths that can only be tested
# inside a real host app — the optimistic lock reaching SQL, a presign taking
# custody in a transaction, a QuickView rendered end to end behind a session —
# so a *library* change can break them just as an example/ change can. The gate
# is therefore fingerprint-gated on BOTH source sets (see _common.sh): it skips
# only when neither has changed since the last passing run, so pure Q&A /
# "thinking" turns don't trigger the suite.
#
# (credo and sobelow are library-only: the example app has no credo dep, and CI
# runs Sobelow against it only via an archive.)
#
# Registered as its own Stop hook entry so it runs in parallel with the
# library's gate (lib-checks.sh). Every check runs even if an earlier one fails.
# On any failure the hook exits 2 so Claude keeps working until the gate is
# green; the loop terminates naturally once all checks pass.
